## Using the Superstore Dataset Data, you are required to build a Dashboard using Tableau that gives better insights for the business executives about the overall performance of the business.
latest year KPIs:

- total profit
- total sales
- total discount
(optional): show the YoY growth rat(comparing the current measure with the prior year)
1. show the quarterly sales over years
2. show the quarterly profit over years
optional: profit margin(%) drilled down by sub-category
top 3 most profitable "corporate" customers.
top 3 most profitable product sub categories in every region.

(optional): show the return rate(orders returned) by sub-category by region
(optional): any chart/s that you may think that can show an important insight/pattern about the business performance.
The dashboard should have a clean and well readable design. You may decide to split the dashboard into two dashboards ( Executive and Operational (orders, customers, etc)) if it is needed.
